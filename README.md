# RESTKit
This is the initial public release of RESTKit, a basic framework which uses cURL to transact HTTP requests and progress the requests into a response. RESTKit can be used out of the box to send calls to any RESTful API with JSON responses and process the data into usable OOP objects with properties that are conscientious of primitive data types.

RESTKit can be extended to more sophisticated class structures with ease and these extensions can be injected to the existing collection and response objects within RESTKit. The nature of RESTKit is to be as simple or as complicated as your SDK requires.
